Kyle is an avid fan of the Mario universe and has spent the semester 
exploring various Mario-themed games, levels, and characters. 
He meticulously records his experiences, including the game titles, 
levels, characters encountered, and his personal rating of each experience.
Now, Kyle is preparing for a project titled "The Super Mario Odyssey: 
A Gamer's Journey Through Mushroom Kingdom and Beyond."
He has compiled all his gaming experiences in a file named 
'mario_adventure_log.txt'. Each record in the file includes the 
game title, level name, characters encountered, and the rating of 
that particular gaming experience. The data is delimited by a '#' symbol.
